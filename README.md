# QuickCraft
#By: DroidVengeance


WHAT DOES IT DO?
Quickly craft items using what you have in your inventory. No need to remember recipes!

USAGE:
  - Shift+RightClick a crafting table to open the GUI. (If "sneakRightClick" is set to TRUE in the plugin config.yml)

    Once the GUI opens, it will display items that you can craft based off the materials in your inventory. Click the items you want,
it will then remove the required matierials from the player's inventory and give them that item. 

    This is still under development!!!! Not ALL items have been added. Basic game items would be a waste of time to add to this as it's 
just as easy to craft them in your 4x4 inventory screen. BUT, if you would like certain items added, just ask!
